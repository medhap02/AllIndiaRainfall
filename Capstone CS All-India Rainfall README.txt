First set of code for my Senior Project
ISM_EPT, ISM_PSH, ISM_CPT, ISM_NAT are each of the variables being generated separately
Model Files are putting variables together and comparing them against real precipitation data
2017 plot is the most accurate, 2019 dataset has issues
In plots, blue is the real precipitation data; orange is the one I have generated
Datasets are all included in the submission or they are online links
